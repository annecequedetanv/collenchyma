Collenchyma is a framework for fast, parallel and hardware-agnostic computation,
similar to [Arrayfire][arrayfire].

Collenchyma was started at [Autumn][autumn] to support fast and parallel
computations, at the Machine Intelligence Framework [Leaf][leaf], on various
backends such as OpenCL, CUDA, or native CPU.
Collenchyma is written in Rust, which allows for a modular and easily extensible
architecture and has no hard dependency on any drivers or libraries, which makes
it easy to use, as it removes long and painful build processes.

Collenchyma comes with a super simple API, which allows you to write code once
and then execute it on one or multiple devices (CPUs, GPUs) without the need to
care for the specific computation language (OpenCL, CUDA, native CPU) or the
underlying hardware.

> Disclaimer: Collenchyma is currently in a very early and heavy stage of
> development. If you are experiencing any bugs that are not due to not yet
> implemented features, feel free to create a issue.
